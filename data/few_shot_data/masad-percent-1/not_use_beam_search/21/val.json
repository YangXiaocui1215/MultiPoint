{"id": "273105868", "text": "the b sierra nevada b is a mountain range that is almost entirely in the eastern portion of the u . s . state of california . the range is also known as the sierra . b geography b the sierra nevada stretches 400 miles ( 650 km ) , from fredonyer pass in the north to tehachapi pass in the south . it is bounded on the west by california 's central valley , and on the east by the great basin . in west east cross section , the sierra is shaped like a non equilateral triangle the altitude gradually increases as you travel east , until you reach the crest , whereupon the altitude rapidly decreases , forming a steep escarpment . thus , the crest runs principally along the eastern edge of the sierra nevada range . rivers flowing west from the sierra crest eventually drain into the pacific ocean , while rivers draining east flow into the great basin and do not reach any ocean . however , water from several streams and the owens river is redirected to the city of los angeles ( see los angeles aqueduct ) . thus , some east flowing river water does make it to the pacific ocean . there are several notable geographical features in the sierra nevada lake tahoe is a large , clear freshwater lake in the northern sierra nevada , with an elevation of 6 , 225 feet ( 1 , 897 m ) and an area of 191 square miles ( 489 km ) . lake tahoe lies between the main sierra and the carson range , a spur of the sierra . hetch hetchy valley , yosemite valley , kings canyon , tehipite valley and kern canyon are the most well known of many beautiful , glacially scoured canyons on the west side of the sierra . yosemite national park is filled with stunning features , such as waterfalls and granite domes . mount whitney , at 14 , 505 feet ( 4 , 421 m ) , is the highest point in the contiguous united states . groves of giant sequoias sequoiadendron giganteum occur along a narrow band of altitude on the western side of the sierra nevada . giant sequoias are the most massive trees in the world . the height of the mountains in the sierra nevada gradually increases from north to south . between fredonyer pass and lake tahoe , the peaks range from 5 , 000 ft . ( 1 , 524 m ) to 8 , 000 ft . ( 2 , 438 m ) . the crest near lake tahoe is roughly 9 , 000 ft ( 2 , 700 m ) high , with several peaks as high as mount rose ( 10 , 778 ft . or 3 , 285 m ) , the crest near yosemite national park is roughly 13 , 000 ft ( 4 , 000 m ) high at mount dana and mount lyell , and the entire range attains its peak at mount whitney . south of mount whitney , the range diminishes in elevation , but there are still several highpoints like florence peak ( 12 , 405 ft . or 3 , 781 m ) and olancha peak ( 12 , 123 ft . or 3 , 695 m ) . the range still climbs almost to 10 , 000 ft . ( 3 , 048 m ) near isabella lake , but south of the lake , the peaks reach only to a modest 8 , 000 ft . ( 2 , 438 m ) . b geology b the geological history of the sierra nevada begins in the jurassic period , approximately 150 million years ago . at that time , an island arc collided with the west coast of north america and raised a set of mountains , in an event called the nevadan orogeny . this event produced metamorphic rock . at roughly the same time , a subduction zone started to form at the edge of the continent . this means that an oceanic plate started to dive beneath the north american plate . magma from the melting oceanic plate rose and created plutons of solid granite , deep below the surface . these plutons formed at various times , from 115 million to 87 million years ago . by 65 million years ago , the proto sierra nevada was worn down to a range of rolling low mountains , a few thousand feet high . about 25 million years ago , the sierra nevada started to rise and tilt to the west . rivers started cutting deep canyons on both sides of the range . the earth 's climate cooled , and ice ages started about 2 . 5 million years ago . glaciers carved out characteristic u shaped canyons throughout the sierra . the combination of river and glacier erosion exposed the granitic plutons previously buried , leaving only a remnant of metamorphic rock on top of some sierra peaks . the rocks of the ancient plutons are known as the sierra nevada batholith . uplift of the sierra nevada continues today , especially along its eastern side . this uplift causes large earthquakes , such as the lone pine earthquake of 1872 .", "image": "/data/xiaocui/datasets/Multimodal_Aspects_Analysis/MASAD/all_image_data/273105868.jpg", "caption": "mountain range are the most popular tourist attraction", "aspect": "cloud", "label": "positive"}

{"id": "2876495959", "text": "greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .", "image":

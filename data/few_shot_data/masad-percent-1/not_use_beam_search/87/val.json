{"id": "2876495959", "text": "greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .", "image":

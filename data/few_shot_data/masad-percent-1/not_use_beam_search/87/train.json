known henceforth as quot julie quot . she begin her racing career at age 2 . she was n't a great success on the track like her grandfather , secretariat . she won a total of 72 . at age 4 , she bowed her tendon and went into retirement , ending up at a small farm in nc to recover . that 's where i come in . . . our lives became intertwined many many years ago , in 1992 . i was 12 years old at the time , and i had been riding for just over 3 years at a local barn , taking riding lessons . i considered myself a pretty good rider all around , though i had n't really worked with any young horses to that point . one day , i went to a local breeding farm with my mom , owned by mr . wilson . i remember seeing this chestnut horse in the back pasture , wearing a blue halter , pacing back and forth in the early evening sun . he told me that she was off the track , four years old , and secretariat was her grandfather . a few weeks later , i arrived for my riding lesson only to see the same horse standing in the pasture at the barn where i took lessons . mr . wilson wanted to make her into a hunter jumper , which would increase her sale value . my riding instructor told me that mr . wilson had brought her there for training . and i could help with her training if i wanted to . of course , i jumped at the chance . we started working with her in early january . i used to put her on crossties in the wash rack , which had a wall behind it . we were afraid she 'd pull back since she was so young . after that , i 'd lunge her for a good 30 mins , each direction , to work the kinks out . then i 'd ride her , limiting it to walking and trotting at first . we had several memorable rides , one of which taught me the fine art of the emergency dismount . on that particular windy day , she spooked at something , i lost my balance and then lost control . the reins flew over her head and she took off . i stayed on 2 times around the riding ring before it was n't fun anymore . i jumped off , on the inside of the ring , and she fell on top of me . luckily , neither of us were hurt . we worked together for a few months , during which a bond was forged . . . the likes of which i have n't experienced since in my life . in early may , she had made enough progress to sell . my instructor gave me first choice , and for a fleeting second i had the hopes that it would actually happen . but in the end , my parents refused . they were n't rich , and horses are really really expensive . it 's not the initial cost , it 's the upkeep , my mom explained . i begged , i pleaded , i yelled . i volunteered to get a job , sell myself into slavery , forego the braces that i did n't really want anyway . i tried to make the most out of the time that i had with her . i read in a book that indians used to breathe into the nostrils of their horses , to make sure they remembered them . maybe i knew then that one day our paths would cross again , and i wanted to do everything i could to make sure she remembered me . i took a camera out to the barn and took pictures , one of which is above . i tried to prepare for the inevitable . but nothing could have prepared me for the loss that i would feel . so , julie was sold . the girl who bought her lived in cherry point , and her father was in the marine corps . one day i arrived at the barn , and she was gone . i remember crying my eyes out to country music while sitting on the couch with a box of kleenex . life went on , barely . my instructor gave me another horse to work with . it was n't the same . i kept comparing the new horse to julie . i quit riding in 1993 , not long after 8th grade started . julie was still with me , even though only in glimpses . i convinced my mother to drive me by the stable where she was , and i creened my neck trying to pick her out from the myriad of horses in the pasture . i saw her picture on the back page of an issue of quot horse illustrated quot magazine where owners submitted pictures of their horses ( still have that magazine , in a safe deposit box , btw ) . i tried to keep track of her the best i could . the last news i had was that her new owner was going off to college , and julie was coming with her . then i lost track . many years later , i was returning from my cousin 's house in new bern , and i rode down the road where she used to be . . . . where i saw her for the last time . i sincerely thought that i would never see her again . six months after that drive , in 1998 , i was in college and considering getting back into riding after a particularly stressful semester . i had finally come to accept the fact that i would never find julie , and i needed to move on . it had been over six years . i was sitting at the computer , by the counter , in my old apartment , surfing the internet , when i came across a site with ads for horses for sale . i was perusing the ads , trying to figure out how much the prices had changed , making calculations , seeing if i could afford it , when i saw the ad . julie . for sale . 10 years old . secretariat bloodlines . my blood ran cold . the ad was from november . it was may when i saw it . i shot off an email in response to the ad , once i was able to stop crying . the response was brief but to the point . quot has been sold . quot obviously , this guy did not realize that he held my sanity and destiny in his hand . i sent a response , pleading for the new owner 's name and address , telling him her registered name , about the birthmark on her hip , anything i could think of to prove that i was legitimate . he was kind enough to send me the new owner 's mailing address , and i sent them a letter . we corresponded by email for two years . they were using her for dressage , and had bred her to a dutch warmblood stallion , so they were n't ready to sell . i was patient . on october 31 , 1999 , i got an email from her owners . they wanted to sell , they were giving me first option . history repeats itself in strange ways . i took a drive to cedar island , trying to think things over . i knew i was going to buy her , the question was . . . how . i had a job that paid decently , without which money would have been a bigger issue . but , that did n't erase the fact that i had n't ridden in 8 years , and was totally unprepared for horse ownership . i enrolled in riding lessons and starting making preparations for buying her . i saw her for the first time in 8 years on january 2 , 2000 , driving 16 hours roundtrip to haymarket , va after staying up all night for the y2k rollover at work . it was an unseasonably warm day . she was the same horse , alright . but she had n't been worked in a long time , and it was going to take a lot of work . but , my mind was made up years ago , and i would have bought her even if she had 3 legs and one eye . on february 26 , 2000 , i met her owners at a truck stop just north of the nc border for the exchange . julie came home with me . then the real adventure began .", "image": "/data/xiaocui/datasets/Multimodal_Aspects_Analysis/MASAD/all_image_data/3229756804.jpg", "caption": "person with her horse which she adopted", "aspect": "horse",
